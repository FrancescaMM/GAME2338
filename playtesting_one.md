**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer: The rules were understandable on the basic level with the overall movement and goal of each level. However after I got level 6 I could not progress because I was unable to figure out how to build my "army" quick enough to defeat the enemy's.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer: The game itself was pretty simple so there were no extra elements that could’ve been removed from the game. It just had the base game area and the players and enemy’s “armies” as needed per level.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer: The game is balanced for the first few levels but then becomes unbalanced and adds in newer types of units to control in order to challenge the player to be more strategic in their game play as they get used to the basic controls and goals of the game.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer: The timing of this game makes even though it’s only used in certain parts to guarantee that oh can’t build a ridiculous army to go against the enemy’s army. However it does allow for enough time in the first few levels in order for the player to fully learn how to build their armies and comfortable attack the enemy without being rushed while still creating their army.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer: The mechanics and theme matched up and were kept simple to focus on the actually strategy of the game rather than on the graphics or overdone details that did not effect the gameply at all.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer: I did enjoy playing this game until level 6 where I got stuck for about 20-30 minutes. I could not figure out how to build up my army quick enough to attack much less defend myself from the enemy when they would time out and attack my base. However the earlier five levels were enjoyable and fun to figure out but able to be figured out in my case.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer: While playing the game I noticed that occasionally a square or two of my army would get stuck into the walls for no apparent reason. I could tell it was from touching the wall but I believe it was a random glitch because it did not happen each time a square hit the wall or even in the same places. Each time a square would get stuck it would be a random spot and sometimes not at all during various play throughs.
