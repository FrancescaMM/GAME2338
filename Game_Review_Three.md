## Summary

Forza Horizon 2 is an open world racing game that is located in different parts of Europe. Primarily the racing and storyline takes place in parts of France and Italy. The campaign is a series of missions(such as races and competitions) that players can either complete themselves or with friends in a co-op mode. There is also the option of having random teammates during the missions since the game is online and open world. This newer element of open world and online is interesting to mix within a racing game is intersting and had it's own appeal.
The graphics in this game is pretty great and there were extra attention to the details even though the areas were massive and would've taken a lot longer to create and load. There was also great detail in the customization of the cars that were available in the game. With over 200 cars to choose from the game made sure to make each car rather distinguishable from each other. Even going so far as to make the driving feel of the cars vary from sports cars to SUV's and other types of cars. Although some of the designs on the cars were rather over done and realistic it was still nice to have such an extra element of creation explored by the developers and to such an intense degree.
Overall the game play of Forza Horizon 2 was smooth and intuitive to the classic controls of any racing game over the years. The gaming environment was also more realistic as it did not simply stay constantly bright with daylight as most games did outside of a few "night time" maps. The environment had days and nights that would cycle through as the player went through the game that was based on the timing intisde the game itself. The online game play did not have much lag even with the great detail of secnery to load and the speed of the individual players and thier cars to account for. There was also content that was released later in the game that offered up even more customized vehicles as well as new maps for the drivers to explore.


## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed playing this game and thought that the steering mechanic of the game was fluid and realistic. The scenery in the game was enjoyable and there was more variation that there had been in the previous game. The playable area was significantly bigger however the campaign itself was rather short. The game's replayability seemed low in my personal opinion unless one really likes replaying racing campaign or is able to keep their multiplayer races from getting too predictable or monotonous. However the classic split screen makes it a good game for local playing for short times.
