## Summary

Forza Horizon 2 

## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed playing this game and thought that the steering mechanic of the game was fluid and realistic. The scenery in the game was enjoyable and there was more variation that there had been in the previous game. The playable area was significantly bigger however the campaign itself was rather short. The game's replayability seemed low in my personal opinion unless one really likes replaying racing campaign or is able to keep their multiplayer races from getting too predictable or monotonous. However the classic split screen makes it a good game for local playing for short times.
