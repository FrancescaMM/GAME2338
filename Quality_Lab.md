Minecraft: Minecraft met all five perspectives of quality, transcendent, product-based, user-based, development and 
Manufactoring based, value-based. The game itself matches the quality of it's game cover, offers the mining and crafting based
gameplay that it promoted, and was a cheap game with cheap aesthetic customizations offered but overall was a straight
forward game payment-wise. Out of the software quality factors Minecraft appealed greatly in correctness, reliability,
and usability. The game always played as it was explained and even with the addition of new environments and NPC's it stayed
correct and true to it's controls and the level of difficulty to craft or mine doesn't increase and is a pretty intuitive game
with extra tutorials to help you when you get stuck.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: In Super Smash Bros. the resuability, portability, and correctness are the key quality points.
The game has many different variations across the old and newer Nintendo consoles because they are able to configure the game
for their newer consoles and it plays the same with usually just updated graphics and smoother gameplay. Also the game has the
same since it's original version with the classic characters available to the players aw well as a few additions that gets the
players more excited without throwing off the balance of the character's fighting.

Portal: Portal had great usability, efficiency, reliability, and correctness. The game was a simple yet challenging puzzle game
where the user had a device that can create two contected portals in order to travel through weirdly layed out rooms with a
goal point to reach each level. The portals always stayed consistent as only two could be active a time and the phsyics didn't
reverse which is how loops could be created which might counter the reliability quality of the game for intellectually 
challenged or very young players.
