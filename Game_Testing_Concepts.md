# Game Testing Concept (Halo 3)

## White Box Testing

### Balance Testing
They were testing the way the weapons worked in the PvP aspecy such as the hammers, shotguns, and swords which are classic favorties to use in Halo.

### Functional Testing
They were making sure the controls were tied correctly and that the hit boxes stayed on point during single play as well as multiplayer.

### Negative Testing
One guy was focused on finding the end areas of the map where it was blank and to see if they could get out of the bounds of the map.

### Performance Testing
They tested the load conditions for the online section of their game to make sure it wouldn't crash the match or offset the aiming in the game.

### Unit Testing
One guy was testing the colors of the armor to make sure that they show the correct color when chosen during character customization.

### Regression Testing
As they updated or tweaked weapons and cosmetics they would go through and retest everything else in the game to make sure that the small change didn't cause an error in another section of the game. 

### Integration Testing
Many of them tested the online playing together to see where it would crash and how the hit boxes work as well as testing the load that their servers could handle.

### Automated Testing
They ran a bunch of Automated testing overnight and during the day to simulate a bunch of users online to make sure it could perform without crashing.

### Localization Testing
They tested the game with other testers who were based in Japan to make sure that the online would work across the servers outside of the U.S.

## Black Box Testing

### Play Testing
Outside testers were brought in to see what parts of the game were fun and which parts weren't so that adjustments could be made to weed out the parts that might kill the game for players and expand on the parts that were found to be enjoyable to the testers.

### Usability Testing
They brought in outside testers to all play the game to see if it was intuitive for the players. Some players would get stuck in parts of the game because they couldn't figure out where they were supposed to go next or how to use the controls well enough to continue. This caused some people to get frustrated and angry while others would give up and ask if they could stop which of course is the opposite result desired by the developers.
