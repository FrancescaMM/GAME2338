### Rating
I give games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8.5 star rating.

## Summary
Monopoly is a classic board game that incorporates two six sided dice and cards 
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I enjoy the combination of pure luck and good strategy that this game requires. There is no set way to move to ensure a victory since the movement on the board is left up to the numbers rolled on the dice so one also needs to be sure to purchase properties on the board correctly. However, one can also not just rely on buying certain properties to lock in the win either since the opponents will vary as well and so the player must take into account other people's possible moves and thoughts before acting on their own. These two main elements of the game keep any one game from being similar to another but also causes each individual game to be a long winded event so much so that it is common for the game to be finished not by the actual intended ending which is one person left with all the money and the rest bankrupt but rather for the game to end due to people choosing to quit until there is one left because they no longer wish to continue the game.
