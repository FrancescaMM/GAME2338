## Summary
Monopoly is a classic board game that incorporates two six sided dice and cards. The game typically consists of at least two and up to eight players. Each player picks out a metal "token" or little figure that represents them on the board during the game. The classic tokens are a dog(schnauzer), a top hat, an old styled car, a thimble, a laceless shoe, an old style flat iron, a wheel barrow, and a ship. Before the game itself can begin one player must be chosen as the banker who will be responsible for handling the money throughout the game aside from playing their own part. Each player starts out with a st amount of money in order to make intial investment purchases so that they can build up more money throughout the game in order to beat the other players. Once the money has been distributed the game can start.

The players all start on a corner together on the board labeled Start and take turns rolling the dice in order to move around the board. A player must do one complete lap around the board before they are able to make any purcases. 

## Final Thoughts
I enjoy the combination of pure luck and good strategy that this game requires. There is no set way to move to ensure a victory since the movement on the board is left up to the numbers rolled on the dice so one also needs to be sure to purchase properties on the board correctly. However, one can also not just rely on buying certain properties to lock in the win either since the opponents will vary as well and so the player must take into account other people's possible moves and thoughts before acting on their own. These two main elements of the game keep any one game from being similar to another but also causes each individual game to be a long winded event so much so that it is common for the game to be finished not by the actual intended ending which is one person left with all the money and the rest bankrupt but rather for the game to end due to people choosing to quit until there is one left because they no longer wish to continue the game.
