### Rating
I give games a rating from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game an 8.5 star rating.

## Summary
In this card game the player takes on the role of a Pokemon Trainer. This means that they collect their "pokemon" and battle them against each other using different attacks and strategys. After a certain amount of damage is inflected on a pokemon they will be considered knocked out and out of the game. To start off the game the players flip a coin and call a side and winner picks who goes first. Each trainer starts with seven cards and picks a basic(starter) Pokemon to put down as their "active" Pokemon that deals damage and takes damage. If a trainer does not pick up a basic pokemon they will reshuffle and draw again. After establishing the basic active pokemon a player may set down up to five more basic pokemon and these will be the pokemo used through out the match. The game typially ends by one player's pokemon all being knocked out of it a player runs out of cards in their deck to pick up.

The Pokemon that a player starts out with will vary on their deck build but they may only have 6 down at a time. After those six are picked and placed down they are only able to evolve those pokemon with their correlating evolved state IF they have that card. During a player's turn they may place up to one energy card for their active pokemon to prepare for an attack in a following turn, they can switch out thie active pokemon is they would like with one of their otehr five "benched" pokemon, or they can attack their opponent if they have enough energy cards stacked at the end of their turn. With a range of moves allowed this really allows the playr to build their team or set their strategy into action while still allows for quick adjustments during the game versus the more strict one move per turn set up.

Another element to this game other than leveling up your pokemon through their evolutions is the energy cards needed in order to attack the opposing Pokemon. The energy cards range from 10 different types which are symbolized on the cards themselves as well as color schemed. The different types are Nature, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Dark, Metal, Fairy, and Normal. Each type has certain perks and only apply to Pokemon that have a a matching color and symbol located on the cards. Some elements do more damage against others such as water over fire and fire over nature. This helps require a balance in the tema the player sets down or for them to have a few personlaized decks if they happen to know if their oppponent favors a certain element.

## Final Thoughts
I personally am not into card games even though I do enjoy strategy games I prefer more balanced conditions and less chance. However I truly enjoyed playing this game as a child since I grew up watching the anime series and am still an avid fan to this day. The basic set up of this game is simple enough to understand and implement which makes sense since it was made for all ages including young children to be able to collect and play. I still have my deck from my childhood and love that I could still build it if I chose to all these years later. The only element to the game that would sometimes throw me off of the game is the extra elements tht match up with the Pokemon. If you know your deck well enough and build it properly then it would not be a problem but for a casual player such as myself this got annoying to try and work with.
