### Rating
I give games a rating from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game an 8.5 star rating.

## Summary
In this card game the player takes on the role of a Pokemon Trainer. This means that they collect their "pokemon" and battle them against each other using different attacks and strategys. After a certain amount of damage is inflected on a pokemon they will be considered knocked out and out of the game. To start off the game the players flip a coin and call a side and winner picks who goes first. Each trainer starts with seven cards and picks a basic(starter) Pokemon to put down as their "active" Pokemon that deals damage and takes damage. If a trainer does not pick up a basic pokemon they will reshuffle and draw again. After establishing the basic active pokemon a player may set down up to five more basic pokemon and these will be the pokemo used through out the match. The game typially ends by one player's pokemon all being knocked out of it a player runs out of cards in their deck to pick up.



## Final Thoughts
I personally am not into card games even though I do enjoy strategy games I prefer more balanced conditions and less chance. However I truly enjoyed playing this game as a child since I grew up watching the anime series and am still an avid fan to this day. The basic set up of this game is simple enough to understand and implement which makes sense since it was made for all ages including young children to be able to collect and play. I still have my deck from my childhood and love that I could still build it if I chose to all these years later. The only element to the game that would sometimes throw me off of the game is the extra elements tht match up with the Pokemon. If you know your deck well enough and build it properly then it would not be a problem but for a casual player such as myself this got annoying to try and work with.
