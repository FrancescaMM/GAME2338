## Summary
Sea of thieves is an online shared-world multiplayer game where a player picks out a unique pirate that is permanently tied to their account unless completely reset. There are different goals to the game that vary from reading treasure maps to find buried treasure on various islands to capturing animals and delivering them to specific people. A goal that is less mission like is venturing to the skeleton forts or skeleton skip battles as they pop up for an abundance of loot. There are also unspecified goals that can be made up by the player such as raiding enemy ships or dueling it on the seas with other online players. While the more troll-like play style may not mesh well with the more casual players it is part of the game itself given that it is Sea of Thieves and not Sea of 'Friends'.

One of the most exciting and irritating parts of the game are the many enemies you face while playing. Snakes on the island do spray damage if you are too close to one, sharks will attack you if you dwell in the water for too long, and skeletons will spawn and attack or chase you around the island. Compared to the other enemies these are small and easier to deal with. While sailing from island to island there are a few different megalodons that will chase your boat for a while before attacking relentlessly unless you dock at a land mass or kill the great beast. Another enemy that follows you around but will not give up pursuit if you dock up to a structure is a skeleton ship which is an AI tatter galleon with a skeleton crew that attempts to sink you. Lastly, there is the Kraken which will turn the water surrounding you for a few miles completely black and severly slow down your boat. After the Kraken has stalled out your movement it attacks you with its tentacles until you are able to kill enough of its tentacles or swim out of the black watered area. 

## Final Thoughts
Sea of Thieves is a fun game with lots of different activities to do in every game session. There is a decent variety to appeal to many dfferent types of gamers from the very casuals to the try hards or the free explorer to the strict mission follower. The different enemies that are found throughout the game keep it from getting too easy or stagnant as you have to constantly keep an eye out for other players, a kraken or megalodon while sailing, and even skeletons or snakes while on an island. The game also keeps up with new updates for constant fixes and new content that so far has been completely free for the players which is refreshing for a rather popular console game.
