### Rating
  I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8 star rating.

## Summary
  This game is about a young boy named Sora who travels with Donald Duck and Goofy who travel between different worlds that 
exist in Disney and Pixar. There are stories for each world where Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy helps the protagonists from the 
world their visiting against either their own antagonists or from the antagonists of Sora and company such as the heartless 
nobodies,or other characters that have been taken over by the darkness which is primarily lead by Master Xehanort. While Sora
and company are the primary protagonists of the game and Master Xehanort is the primary antagonist there are different antagonists
per world or level that are more in line with the original story of the world that they are visting. Most of the world's story
sticks to the story that is played out in the movies made by Disney and Pixar. The game itself has many story arcs underlying
an overall arc that extends back to before Sora was even born when the original dark moment that started the story which mainly
follows Master Xehanort as he tries to create the ultimate Keyblade in order to become the most powerful being in the Kingdom.
  The mechanics of this game are based around slashing and dashing play styles. Sora's main weapon he uses to battle enemies
in the game is a large Keyblade which he wields as a regular blade even though it has a key appearance. There are also elements
that are added to his keyblade as you level up in various worlds that have different advantages such as some will give back
health while others do more damage to enemies. 
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game.
You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
  I liked this game although I do think I was missing a big chunk of the overall story since I did not play the previous eleven
installments of the game. I was able to watch a few videos put up by others who were able to summarize the plot and story so
far so that I was not completely lost when I started up the game. What was nice about trying this game without any previous
knowledge about the series was that I was able to fully test the intuitiveness of the controls since I did not grow up playing
the first installments and did not already know the controls at all and only learned through the demo the game gave before it
started the actual storyline. I liked the different worlds that were vistied since I enjoy Disney and Pixar a lot personally.
The different character customizations to match the worlds that the trio were in were fun and interesting to see since the
worlds had pretty different apperances such as Pirates of the Caribbean versus Monsters Inc. I would greatly recommend this game
to others and plan on playing the previous installments so that I can grasp the story even better and enjoy it to the fullest.
